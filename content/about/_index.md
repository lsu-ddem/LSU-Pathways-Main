## **More about LSU Pathways** 

 ## The LSU STEM Pathways program provides access to over 24 project-based middle and high school STEM courses as well as STEM modules for middle and elementary school grades. 

 <br>

 Students who participate in the LSU Pathways curriculum can choose to take courses in one or more of the following subject areas:

 
  - Computing and Cybersecurity
  - Digital Design and Emergent Media
  - Environmental Protection and Sustainability
  - Pre-Engineering
  - Pre-Healthcare and Pre-Veterinary
  

<br>

All Pathways contain common themes, thus allowing students to transfer between Pathways up to their junior year.

  - Computational thinking, data management and analysis
  - Development of 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, collaboration, and appropriate use of technology
  - Cultivation of acumen in areas that contribute to success in STEM-related fields such as research & analysis, innovation & creativity, and professional ethics

<br>
Students taking these courses can attain industry-promulgated credentials, university-issued certificates of course completion, and/or dual enrollment credit. Students who successfully complete 4 of the required courses in one Pathway will earn a Silver STEM Diploma Seal. Students will earn a Gold STEM Diploma Seal by satisfying the requirements for a Silver STEM Diploma Seal plus 4 additional Elective Gold Courses from the Qualifying Course List. Completion of a Pathway, which consists of 8 courses in a single subject area, will earn student either a career-tech diploma or an enhanced university prep-diploma.
