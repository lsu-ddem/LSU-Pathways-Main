## **More about LSU Pathways** 

 ## LSU STEM Pathways first took shape at Liberty Magnet High School in Baton Rouge in collaboration with LSU faculty. <!-- *MORE HISTORY HERE* -->

 <br>

 In addition to taking courses in the four core subject areas of English, math, science, and social studies, students who participate in the LSU Pathways curriculum can choose to take courses in one of the following subject areas: 

  - Biomedical Sciences
  - Computing
  - Digital Design and Emergent Media
  - Pre-Engineering
 

<br>

LSU STEM Pathways provides high school students with the opportunity to enroll in a progression of up to eight project-based STEM courses to attain industry-promulgated credentials, university-issued certificates of course completion, and/or dual enrollment credit. Students graduate with either a career-tech diploma or an enhancement to their university-prep diploma with a Silver or Gold STEM Diploma Seal.

<br>

<!-- Under the approved state education funding formula, a school district offering a BESE-approved LSU STEM Pathway course that is taught by a trained and LSU-certified teacher receives $482 per student per course in the form of Career Tech and Career Development supplements. In the LSU STEM Pathways, the bulk of the student credentialing is not done by industry, but by LSU or ULM. -->

<!-- Lee needs to be changed to Liberty here -->


From 2020 on, supported by federal funding, LSU and the East Baton Rouge Parish School System have expanded the LSU Computing Pathway to middle schools and will expand the reach of Introduction to Computational Thinking, a foundational core course in all four LSU STEM Pathways, to schools across the state. Moreover, a collaborative effort of the Louisiana Department of Education, the RAND Corporation, BloomBoard, and LSU will be rolling out Micro-Credentials for STEM Pathway teachers.

The statewide rollout of the LSU STEM Certification Pathways is a joint effort of the Louisiana Department of Education, Liberty Magnet High School, and faculty from Louisiana State University’s Gordon A. Cain Center for STEM Literacy, College of Engineering, College of Science, School of Art, School of Music, and the LSU Center for Computation & Technology.
<br><br>
 
 ## In short, LSU STEM Certification Pathways provides:

- Students with the opportunity to enroll in a specialized program of project-based courses.
- Teachers with the opportunity to further their academic credentials by participating in intensive graduate-level LSU Pathways training courses.
- School districts with additional state funding.
