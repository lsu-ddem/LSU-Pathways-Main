## Course Information
<br>
With this program, the LSU Pathways team provides training to elementary school teachers selected by the district. The selected teachers spend three weeks with Pathways instructors training in project-based learning modules that utilize STEM activities. 
<br>
<br> 
Teachers then are able to adapt the lessons for use in their existing curriculum to help students get creative with dynamic, hands-on projects while learning about teamwork and engaging with the building blocks of STEM.
