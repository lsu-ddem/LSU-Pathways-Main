## LSU Pathways for elementary school consists of introductory courses designed to help students get excited about STEM subjects. 
<br>

With this program, the LSU Pathways team provides training to elementary school teachers selected by the district. The selected teachers spend three weeks with Pathways instructors training in project-based learning modules that utilize STEM activities. 
<br> 

 Teachers then are able to adapt the lessons for use in their existing curriculum to help students get creative with dynamic, hands-on projects while learning about teamwork and engaging with the building blocks of STEM.
