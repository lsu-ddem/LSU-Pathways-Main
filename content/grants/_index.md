## Micro-Credential Grant
<br>

What is the Louisiana STEM Micro-Credential Project?
This project involves the development and testing of a set of micro-credentials intended to allow teachers to apply what they have learned through their STEM Pathway training to the classes they teach. The partners involved in this project include:

- Louisiana Department of Education (LDOE)
- Louisiana State University (LSU) 
- BloomBoard
- RAND Corporation

## BRBytes Grant 
<br>
The US Department of Education granted LSU $4M through the Education Innovation and Research Program Grant to study the impact of Computational Thinking in the learning of Mathematics.

This is an Early-Phase research project to study a course developed by LSU, Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT), that integrates teaching the fundamentals of computing, programming, and mathematics reinforcement in a project-based setting with functions as the overarching theme.

If successful, this study will inform development of future courses nationwide that integrate the two subjects. This is a high-stakes study with possible long term benefits.


#### The BRBytes Sequence

The BRBytes Sequence is a two-year, two-course sequence for high school students, beginning the year they take Algebra I. Students will take:

1. Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT)
2. ONE of the following BRBytes Electives (depending on which the school offers):
        1. Cybersecurity
        2. Introduction to Engineering Design
        3. Introduction to Biomedical Sciences

Students must take both ICT and a BRBytes Elective, one course per academic year. To participate in the BRBytes Research Study, the order students take these two classes must be determined by randomization by the studyâ€™s evaluator.

#### School Requirements

1. Commit to offering the _BRBytes Sequence_ at your school for at least 2 years.
2. Recruit 2 teachers to teach the BRBytes courses (Introduction to Computational Thinking and a BRBytes Elective).
        1. If you are unsure which BRBytes Elective you want to offer, we suggest Cybersecurity because it is a universal Jump Start 2.0 course.
3. Designate 1 counselor as the point of contact for student recruitment and registration.
4. Enroll 20-50% of students taking Algebra I in the _BRBytes Sequence_.
        1. This should be a minimum of two sections of each course with approximately 20 students per section.

#### Main Activities & Objectives

1. Refine the ICT curriculum to better align it with math standards and make it more culturally relevant. The refined curriculum is expected to increase student math achievement, increased appreciation of computing and awareness of careers in the field.
2. Deliver parts of the existing five-week teacher training online to shorten the face-to-face part to two weeks and better serve distant rural districts.
3. Raise awareness of computing in parents and school administrators, to ensure equitable access by underserved students.

#### Counselor Requirements

1. Help recruit Algebra I students for the study.
2. Coordinate with the BRBytes staff to correctly assign participating students to their randomized courses (see _The BRBytes Sequence_ section for more information on randomization).
3. Track the progress of BRBytes students.
4. Devote half a day during the recruitment period to coordinate student enrollment with the BRBytes staff.
5. Devote half a day before final scheduling (typically in July/August) for a schedule review of BRBytes students.

Counselors will receive a $450 stipend per year for participating in the study. This stipend may be subject to state-mandated deductions.

#### Teacher Requirements

1. Commit to teaching _BRBytes Sequence_ courses for at least 2 years.
2. Attend the 5-week virtual summer training institute to learn how to teach both _BRBytes Sequence_ courses their school will offer.
3. Participate in monthly Community of Practice meetings.
4. Agree to on-site follow-up for at least two years.
5. Maintain an open line of communication with the BRBytes staff.

Teachers will receive a $4,100 stipend per year for participating in the study. This stipend is subject to state-mandated deductions.

#### National Science Foundation Grant


BRBytes has developed a research practitioner partnership through the  Computer Science for All - Researcher Practitioner Partnerships grant from the National Science Foundation.

This grant supports the development and implementation of the BRBytes Pathway, a series of computing courses for students from 7th to 12th grade. Eventually, BRBytes hopes to broaden the impact of this program both statewide and regionally by collaborating with researchers and educators in Florida, North Carolina, and Texas.

#### Program Goals

1. increase principal, counselor and parent awareness about careers in computing and the importance of equity in the recruiting and advising of students in this area
2. increase the number of minority teachers from the existing pool who are willing and ready to teach computing courses
3. encourage the use of culturally responsive practices and pedagogies to inspire traditionally underrepresented groups
4. increase student engagement in computing courses and their preparedness for further computing programs
5. promote student awareness and aspirations towards computing careers starting at middle school

#### Courses Developed

- Introduction to STEM Pathways & Careers
- Survey of Computer Science
- Introduction to Computational Thinking
- Data Manipulation & Analysis
- Cybersecurity
- Interactive Computing
- Programming for STEM

#### Reaching Underserved Populations

1. Train teachers in culturally relevant pedagogy
2. Expand current curriculum to incorporate culturally relevant topics
3. Foster teacher/student collaboration in creating new lessons and enhancing existing lessons
4. Increase number of minority teachers serving as role models

[Brbytes - ComputingBrief.pdf](https://www.brbytes.org/ComputingBrief.pdf)

The BRBytes Pathway is integrated into the LSU STEM Computing Pathway for high school students.

#### Program Activities

1. train principals/counselors to advocate for computing courses/careers
2. recruit teachers and provide them with training/yearly support to implement computing courses
3. develop a new semester course for 7th grade and adapt and existing 9th grade course for 8th grade
4. promote district-wide 7-12th grade computing track and monitor student progress on it

#### Principle & Counselor Requirements

1. encourage students to enroll in BRBytes courses
2. encourage and support teachers in participating in BRBytes summer training

#### Plans for Broadening Participation of African American Teachers

1. to include as large a subsample of minority teachers in our professional development (PD) as possible
2. to discuss strategies to retain minorities in computer science programs during the PD training
3. to include culturally responsive strategies in the teacher training
4. to leverage the resources of the Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing Sciences (IAAMCS), one of the NSF-funded Broadening Participation in Computing Alliances, and whose director, Juan Gilbert, is on our advisory board

#### Teacher Requirements

1. attend the 5-week virtual summer training
2. teach the BRBytes course(s) they are trained in
3. participate in monthly Community of Practice meetings
